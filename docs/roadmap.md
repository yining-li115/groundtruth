# Roadmap

Build order is "make it work, then make it cool." Each phase is a coherent chunk Claude
Code can take on. Check items off as they land; update CLAUDE.md §7 when an open
decision resolves.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundation
- [x] Monorepo scaffold: `apps/kiosk`, `apps/controller`, `apps/relay`, `packages/ui`,
      `packages/tokens`, `packages/protocol`, `content/` (per CLAUDE.md §4). npm
      workspaces.
- [x] Install the locked stack (CLAUDE.md §3). No extras. (React 19, Vite 8,
      Storybook 10, Tailwind v4, R3F 9, gsap/lenis/zustand/framer-motion,
      socket.io/-client, tsx for the relay.)
- [x] `packages/tokens`: encode all colors from `docs/design-system.md` as TS constants
      (`palette`, `themes`) + CSS variables (`tokens.css`, `--gt-*`). `theme.light` is
      the default at `:root`; `theme.dark` is the optional idle backdrop at
      `[data-theme="dark"]` — same token names in both.
- [x] Shared protocol types file: `packages/protocol` (per `docs/architecture.md` §5),
      imported by relay, kiosk, controller.
- [x] Storybook initialized in `packages/ui` with light + dark backgrounds configured.
- [x] Logo wired in from `assets/logo/` as a `<Logo>` component (inline SVG; `variant`
      gives the white-recolor path for dark). Story renders on light + dark.
- [x] Node version pinned: `.nvmrc` → `22` and root `package.json` `engines`
      (`node >=22`, `npm >=10`). Node 22 is the active LTS line the whole stack was
      installed and verified on; `nvm use` keeps every machine on it.

## Phase 1 — Communication backbone (do this BEFORE anything pretty)
This is the project's only make-or-break risk. Prove it first.
- [x] `apps/relay`: socket.io server (`RoomManager`), room-by-sessionId, token queue
      state machine (`docs/architecture.md` §3), driver-only input forwarding, idle /
      pass / disconnect release, per-driver input rate-limit (§9).
- [x] `apps/kiosk`: connect + register room (`kiosk:hello`), static QR (`qrcode.react`),
      inertia cursor driven by forwarded `dx,dy`/tap/scroll; idle ↔ interactive via
      `room:driverChanged`.
- [x] `apps/controller`: opens via `/c/:sessionId` (manual parse, no router),
      `TrackpadSurface` (relative `dx,dy` + tap + two-finger scroll, rAF-coalesced),
      driver/queued/passed UI, pass + idle countdown + heartbeat. Honors reduced motion.
- [x] State-machine verified by a scripted end-to-end smoke test (kiosk + 2 controllers):
      driver assignment, queue, queued-input rejection, pass→promotion (`youAreUp`),
      disconnect→idle. All 11 assertions pass.
- [x] Real-phone E2E on the **same Wi-Fi (LAN)** PASSED — driver/queue/pass verified on
      actual devices.
- [ ] **Cross-network E2E (phone on 4G, kiosk on eduroam)** — still blocked on the relay
      deployment decision (CLAUDE.md §7): needs a public deploy target + domain for the
      QR URL. Deferred by choice until the content structure lands.

## Phase 2 — Content structure
- [x] Content schema (`content/schema.ts`, zod + inferred types) + `content/*.json`
      placeholder data (2–3 realistic items each: People, Research topics, Student
      projects, Teaching, showreel) + `content/media/` folders. No standalone Photo
      gallery — photos folded into People (`photo` + `photos[]`). Avatars via DiceBear
      URLs, detail photos via picsum.
- [x] `npm run check:content` validator (zod-based) — schema + duplicate-id + dangling
      cross-ref + non-URL media-existence checks; exits non-zero on failure. (Wired to
      the npm script; **CI hookup still TODO** — no CI configured yet.)
- [x] Four browsable sections in `apps/kiosk/src/scenes`: People, Research, Student
      projects, Teaching — plain token-styled lists rendering `content/*.json` (id refs
      resolved to names). Navigated via zustand view-state (no router).
  - [x] **Teaching upgraded to real content + custom treatment**: `courses.json` now holds the
        real Winter 2025/26 + Summer 2026 courses (schema extended with `courseNo` / `courseType`
        / `hoursPerWeek`, `level`/`ects`/`instructorIds`/`summary` made optional — see
        content-model §4). The page is a term-grouped **monospace course table** where each row
        terminal-"decode"-glitches on hover (`components/GlitchText.tsx`, reimplemented from
        Codrops LineTextHoverAnimations without SplitType; fired by the kiosk cursor's `is-hover`).
        People / Research / Projects are still plain placeholder lists.
- [x] **Interactive home (landing) + navigation menu** — the post-takeover website shell
      that holds the sections (`docs/architecture.md` §6). Brand top-left, motto headline,
      bottom control hint, Logo / controller "back" → home. Nav is **`StaggeredMenu`** (a
      corner "MENU" button → side drawer with the four sections), not a horizontal row —
      see §6. The central area carries the **point-cloud hero** (next item), not a
      placeholder.
- [ ] Idle showreel as its own auto-playing standby screen (independent of home; may
      reuse the same content JSON as source material) — `docs/architecture.md` §6.
- [ ] Idle ↔ interactive mode switching driven by `room:driverChanged`. (NOT done yet:
      the website shell currently renders regardless of driver so it's directly
      previewable; the showreel + gating land with the item above.)
- [x] `PROJECT-MAP.md` at repo root — plain-language (Chinese) guide to where each kind
      of thing lives, so a non-programmer can find what to edit.

## Phase 3 — Component library (ongoing, starts here)
- [ ] Build the priority components (`docs/component-library.md` §5), each with a story.
- [ ] Migrate ad-hoc UI from phases 1–2 into `packages/ui` as it stabilizes.
- [x] **Scroll/motion foundation** wired (`apps/kiosk/src/lib/scroll.ts`): Lenis smooth
      scroll + GSAP ScrollTrigger kept in sync, reduced-motion-guarded; the phone's
      two-finger scroll routes through Lenis (`scrollByPx`), the home hero keeps reading
      `window.scrollY` unchanged. Plumbing only — per-component scroll choreography
      (reveals / pins / parallax) lands with the content-feed polish below.
- [x] **Home Spotlight = horizontal WebGL parallax gallery** (`components/SpotlightGallery.tsx`
      + `experiments/gallery/galleryGL.ts`, ported from the Codrops horizontal-parallax-gallery
      demo, three.js — our stack). The section is **pinned** and a scrubbed ScrollTrigger maps
      vertical scroll → the gallery's horizontal position, so the visitor "scrolls on" to browse
      spotlights sideways; per-image uv parallax + rounded corners in the shader. Phone: the
      two-finger `dy` already drives Lenis → ScrollTrigger converts it to horizontal (no
      controller change). Images are **picsum placeholders** for now; real content cards later.
      Note: adds a 2nd WebGL context on the home (alongside the hero point cloud).
      Polish: `anticipatePin:1` smooths the vertical→horizontal handoff from the hero; the
      per-image parallax strengthened; the reusable `BlurScrollText` / `HoverCaption` /
      `HeroScrollHint` pieces migrated into `packages/ui` (each with a story).
- [x] **Hero → Spotlight transition** polish: hero canvas bottom feathered (CSS mask) so the
      dispersed particles fade into the page; the motto + a bouncing "Spotlight ↓" hint
      (`HeroScrollHint`) blur/fade OUT and the big "Spotlight" title blurs IN, via a reusable
      `BlurScrollText` (adapted from Codrops ScrollBlurTypography — per-char `filter: blur()`
      scrubbed on scroll; opacity instead of brightness for our black-on-light type).
- [~] **Home News = 3D staggered scroll grid** (`components/NewsGrid.tsx`, adapted from Codrops
      Staggered3DGridAnimations to our light theme + a Lusion "Featured Work" layout: big
      near-full-width two-column cards that rise with a restrained 3D tilt + blur as they scroll).
      Picsum placeholders + fake copy for now. Real (mostly text-only) news still needs a `date`
      field + external `link` on the schema (per CLAUDE.md rule 3) and likely a different
      text-first treatment.
- [x] **Home Open Topics = full-bleed depth gallery** (`components/OpenTopicsDepth.tsx` +
      `experiments/depth/`, vendored from Codrops `codrops-depth-gallery`, three.js). The visitor
      keeps scrolling DOWN; the section is a **sticky** stage inside a tall section so it rises
      continuously from beneath News (no blank gap), then page-scroll drives the camera through a
      stack of poster planes in 3D depth (a scrubbed ScrollTrigger → `setScrollProgress`, the
      engine's own wheel hijack off via `externalScroll`). The entry plane reads like a normal
      editorial section (heading + poster + caption beside it); deeper planes carry per-plane
      "mood" backgrounds that the GLSL background blends through — a **white → gray → black**
      descent (token grays). Preview at `/?exp=depth`. Posters are placeholder (`poster.webp`).
- [x] **Cursor-fluid garnish on home** (`experiments/liquid/LiquidEther.tsx`, vendored from
      React Bits' LiquidEther — a GPU stable-fluids sim, three.js). A faint, fixed full-page layer
      (`.home-fluid`) in front of content whose trail follows the cursor across the whole home.
      Driven by our cursor (`lib/cursorPosition`: `Cursor.tsx` publishes the kiosk pointer;
      `activePointer()` prefers a real mouse in dev, the phone-driven cursor on the kiosk) instead
      of the upstream window listeners. Brand palette (`assetColors`); reduced-motion skips it.
      Preview at `/?exp=liquid`. Note: a 4th WebGL context on the home.
- [x] **Pixel page transition** on section navigation (`components/PixelOverlay.tsx` +
      `lib/pixelTransition.ts`, reimplemented from Codrops PixelTransition demo 4). A fixed
      full-screen grid of cells scatter-scales IN to cover, the view swaps behind the cover, then
      scatter-scales OUT to reveal. All user navigation routes through `lib/navigate` (menu items,
      back-to-home, controller back). Black pixels (`brand-black`); reduced-motion skips to the swap.

## Phase 4 — WebGL façade
- [~] Hero scene for R3F: an interactive **point cloud** (on-brand for a remote-sensing
      group). **Started early and relocated** — it drives the **interactive home hero**
      (`apps/kiosk/src/scenes/Home.tsx` via `experiments/showcase/Scene.tsx`): a city +
      satellites + car + sensor "data lines" assembled from ~140k particles,
      scroll-disperses, cursor-orbits (§4/§6). Single indigo asset color (off-token by the
      design-system "asset colors" exception). The live home geometry is still a
      **procedural box stand-in**. Still WIP (composition/feel); not yet promoted into
      `packages/ui` or `webgl/`.
  - [~] **GLB-model variant** (experiment-only, preview at `/?exp=showcase`):
        `experiments/showcase/SceneModels.tsx` + `sampleModels.ts` surface-sample real
        Sketchfab GLBs (towers / car / satellite / drone / tree) into the same 140k-point
        cloud — a far less crude city than the boxes. **Decoupled** from the live home hero
        (the procedural `Scene.tsx` is untouched); promote into `Home.tsx` only once the
        look is locked. GLB binaries are gitignored (`apps/kiosk/public/models/`, manifest
        in its `README.md`); the two big towers still need decimation/texture-stripping
        before they'd ever be committed.
- [ ] Postprocessing pass (bloom/DOF) for the Lusion look, perf-budgeted for the kiosk
      hardware. NOTE: Bloom was deliberately dropped from the hero point cloud — it
      blew out the dense particles and hurt readability; density + crisp soft sprites
      read better. Revisit only if a scene genuinely needs it. (Perf: hero caps canvas
      `dpr` to 1.5 and disables MSAA so the 140k points don't stutter while scrolling.)
- [ ] Keep navigation fully functional without the WebGL layer (CLAUDE.md rule 6).
- [ ] CANDIDATE: glass-material treatment (React Bits "Fluid Glass", R3F
      `MeshTransmissionMaterial`) for the navigation menu. Re-implement with TUM tokens,
      not pasted as-is (CLAUDE.md rule 9); needs a `.glb` model asset; perf-budget it.
      CAUTION on the cursor: a refracting/chromatic-aberration material can hurt cursor
      legibility and follow feel — the cursor's job is to be clear and tracked. Test
      before committing; readability wins over flash.

## Phase 5 — Waiting game + polish
- [ ] Endless-runner mini-game in the controller queued state.
- [ ] Transitions, sound (optional), reconnect/edge-case hardening
      (`docs/architecture.md` §8).
- [ ] Reduced-motion audit on the controller.
- [ ] Real content swap-in.

---

## Pending decisions (mirror of CLAUDE.md §7)
- [x] Dark/light palette — RESOLVED: light-first, no landing page (design-system §5).
- [ ] Relay deployment target + domain for the QR URL.
- [ ] Real content + media assets.
- [x] Web font — RESOLVED: **TUM Neue Helvetica** (official TUM identity font), wired
      as `--font-sans` in `packages/tokens`; WOFF2 in `packages/tokens/src/fonts/`,
      source TTFs in `assets/fonts/`. See design-system §4.
